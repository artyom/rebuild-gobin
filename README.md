rebuild-gobin rebuilds binaries under GOBIN if they were built with a
different Go version.

Tool first scans $GOBIN directory (defaults to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin)
with the "go version -m" command to figure out module version and Go version
for each binary, then runs "go install path@version" for each command's
path.

For example, if there's a httpstat binary inside a GOBIN directory, then "go
version -m $(which httpstat)" outputs something like this:

    ~ Â¶ go version -m go/bin/httpstat

rebuild-gobin will then run "go install
github.com/davecheney/httpstat@v1.0.0" if it detects that version reported
by "go version" differs from one that binary was built with.

If you run this tool with "-u" flag, then it will call "go install
path@latest" for each binary, forcing their update to the latest available
version.

This tool relies on "go install" semantics introduced in Go 1.16 (see
https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40276 for more details).
